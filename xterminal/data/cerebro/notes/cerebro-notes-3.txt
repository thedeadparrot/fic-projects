Session:

A new conductive polymer was developed been developed by researchers as the University of Waterloo
several months ago. Hank was hopeful that it could improve performance of the helmet, and we have
started doing testing. This will be our third run.


Results:

- Bad headaches for several hours. Too many minds too quickly.  

- Hank is still looking into mitigating this issue in further trials.


Other thoughts:

- It was all very muddled, but I remember that there was a man looking for his son in the woods. It
was dark where he was, with long, angry shadows. His mind was very loud.
