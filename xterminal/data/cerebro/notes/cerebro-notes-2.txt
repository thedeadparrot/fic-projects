Session:

One of the new students, also a telepath, has requested an observation session so that she could see
the behavior of Cerebro while it was active. 


Results:

- Standard session. No unusual effects.


Other thoughts:

- Found the loveliest young mutant in Canada who was quite excited to "meet" me. She said that my
speech last spring was inspiring, though she doesn't feel like her powers (slightly enhanced sight)
are risky enough to warrant admission to the school.

- Shawn thought it was 'very cool beans' to be able to touch so many minds at once. I doubt he will
ever become powerful enough to use Cerebro himself, but I did enjoy the chance to share this with
him.
