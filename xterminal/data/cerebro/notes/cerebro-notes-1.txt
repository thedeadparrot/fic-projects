October 7, 1998

Session:
We have attempted to boost the power to the outer panels to see if it will fix
the glitch we were seeing earlier. I would sometimes lose connection with
the minds I was connected to and get a uncomfortable headache afterwards.

Early tests have indicated that the power distribution has smoothed, so I am
confident that we will see an improvement.


Results:
- This session may have been too short, but the previous issues have not
reoccurred.
- We may have improved the overall reach of the contraption as well. I could
distinctly sense the minds of people as far away as Kabul.

Other notes:
- Scott made comments about his discomfort with my continuing willingness to
'act as guinea pig' as he calls it, but I believe Hank may have talked him down.
- A rescue mission for a girl in Detroit has been launched. Photokinetic.
Abusive parents. A lack of friends or support system. There are so many who need
us and so few that we can actually save.
