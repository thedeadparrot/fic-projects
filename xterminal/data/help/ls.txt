ls [-a] <directory>

Lists files in the given directory. If no directory is given, defaults to listing the files in the
current directory.

In this file listing, directories will be displayed with a trailing slash (i.e. pictures/).

If the -a option is used, hidden files will also be displayed.

To better understand how to interact with particular directories, type 'help files'.

Examples:

Display files in the current directory:

  ls

Display files in the pictures directory:

  ls pictures/

Display all files in the pictures directory:

  ls -a pictures/
