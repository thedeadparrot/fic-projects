There are two types of filenames and directory names: relative and absolute. Absolute filenames
begin with '~/' which represents the home directory.

Take this example filesystem:

~/
	pictures/
		picture1.jpg
	music/
		variousartists/
			song1.mp3

The absolute filename for 'picture1.jpg' is '~/pictures/picture1.jpg'. The absolute directory name
for 'variousartists' is '~/music/variousartists/'.

Relative filenames are based on your current directory. These do not start with any special
characters. For example, if your current directory is 'pictures', the relative filename for
'picture.jpg' is 'picture.jpg'. If your current directory is the home directory, the relative
filename for 'picture.jpg' is 'pictures/picture.jpg'

You can use '..' to specify the parent directory of your current directory. For example, if your
current directory is 'pictures', you can use the relative filename ''../music' to specify the
'music' directory.
		
Tab completion exists for filenames and directory names, so you can start typing out the relative or
absolute name of a file or a directory, and then press the TAB key to try to automatically complete
it.
