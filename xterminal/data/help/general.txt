Here is a list of commands that you can run:

ls - list all of the files in a given directory
cd - change the current directory to a given directory 
cat - print the contents of a given text file onto the screen
view - view the given image 
play - play a video file

To run a command, type it into the terminal followed by any additional arguments.

For example, if you type:

ls music

you will see:

  playlists/

If you type:

  cd music

and then:

  ls

you will also see:

  playlists/

To see more detailed documentation on what each command does, type 'help <command name>'. You can
also type 'help filenames' to better understand filenames.

Tab completion exists for filenames, so you can start typing out the name of a file or a directory,
and then press the tab key to try to complete it.
