Here is a list of commands that you can run:

ls - list all of the files in a given directory
cd - change the current directory to a given directory 
cat - print the contents of a given text file onto the screen
view - view the given image 
play - play a video or audio file
decrypt - decrypt a file or directory
exit - logout from this session

Most of these commands take a complete file path, which means the path to the file as well as the 
name of the file. You can type 'help files' to better understand how to access files.

To see more detailed documentation on what each command does, type 'help <command name>'. 
Tab completion exists for filenames, so you can start typing out the name of a file or a directory,
and then press the tab key to try to complete it.
