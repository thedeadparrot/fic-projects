Here is a list of commands that you can run:

ls - list all of the files in a given directory
cd - change the current directory to a given directory 
cat - print the contents of a given text file onto the screen
view - view the given image 
play - play a video or audio file
decrypt - decrypt a file or directory
exit - logout

To see more detailed documentation on what each command does, type 'help <command name>'. You can
also type 'help filenames' to better understand filenames.

Tab completion exists for filenames, so you can start typing out the name of a file or a directory,
and then press the tab key to try to complete it.

To scroll up or scroll down, use the PgUp and PgDown keys.
