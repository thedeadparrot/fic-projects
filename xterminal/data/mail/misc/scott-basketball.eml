Subject: New Basketball Rules

It looks like we might need to institute some official rules regarding the basketball games.
Some of the students are complaining about unfair use of powers, and I think we need to make clear
what is an acceptable use of powers and what is not.

Here's my draft of the proposed additional rules:

1) Only two prehensile appendages can be used to dribble the ball and must be declared before the
start of the game. 
2) Any use of flying will be an automatic off-sides.
3) Duplicating yourself will be considered the same thing as putting another player onto the court,
regardless of the fact that you're the same person.
4) Teleportation, telekinesis, illusions, and reality manipulation for any reason is expressly
prohibited.
5) Enhanced senses are not prohibited, but telepaths are not allowed to distract other players with
their powers.

I'd love any feedback you have on this.
