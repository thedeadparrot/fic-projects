Subject: Warning: Do not go near the third floor bathroom

Everyone,

The third floor bathroom is filled with the toxic remnants of a failed stinkbomb. Do not go near
there until I or one of the other teachers gives the okay. We have put up yellow warning tape, but
I know that some of you are you not very observant about such things.

As a future note, it is not suggested that you use plasmoids if you don't fully understand how they
interact with the chemicals you have stolen from the closet in the chemistry room.

-Ms. Monroe
