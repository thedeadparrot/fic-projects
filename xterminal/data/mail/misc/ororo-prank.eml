Subject: Warning: Do not go near the third floor bathroom

Everyone,

The third floor bathroom is filled with the toxic remnants of a failed stinkbomb. Do not go near
there until I or one of the other teachers tells you that it is safe again. We have put up yellow
warning tape, but I know that some of you are you not very observant about such things.

As a future note, it is not suggested that you generate plasmoids near chemicals that you have
stolen from the closet in the chemistry room, especially if you do not know they might react to one
another.

-Ms. Monroe
