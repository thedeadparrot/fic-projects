Subject: Intro chapter?
Hey Charles,

Got your latest draft a few days ago. Looking good, man! I noticed we're still missing that
introduction chapter that you said you wanted to put into it last time we talked.

Are we still on for that? It's no problem if you aren't. I know you said you were having some
trouble picking a direction you want to go in. Anything I can do to help with that?
