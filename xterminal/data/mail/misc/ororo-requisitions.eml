Professor,

Many of us have been without uniforms since the incident with the mechanical arm last week in the
danger room. As of right now, we do not have the funds allocated for the amount of black leather
that would be needed to construct new uniforms. I assume that I am allowed to use some of the cash
from the discretionary funds for this?

Sincerely,
Ororo
