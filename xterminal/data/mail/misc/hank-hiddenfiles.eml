Charles-

I would suggest looking at your .bashrc file in your home (~/) directory. It's a hidden file, so it
won't show up normally if you type 'ls', but you can see it if you type 'ls -a'. Any files with
a filename that begin with a period will be hidden that way, but you can view it like any other file
by typing 'cat ~/.bashrc'.
