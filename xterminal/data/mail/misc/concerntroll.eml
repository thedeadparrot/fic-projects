Subject: Issues with the 'Mutant Rights' movement

Professor Xavier,

I read an interview with you in Time Magazine just last week (June 28), and though you were quite
articulate and passionate in your advocacy, I do think you failed to address some very important
points.

As the concerned mother of three children, I don't think you have considered the point of view of
many humans out there. When I was growing up, there weren't any mutants to worry about. We knew
exactly what sorts of people were going to be out there in the world that we'd have to deal with.

Nowadays, with all the different sorts of mutants running around, my children will be growing up
that I don't know how to protect them from. I can teach them not to talk to strangers, and I can
teach them to look both ways when crossing the street, but what can I teach them about how to
defend against people with the ability to move things with their minds? How can I protect against
people who are strong enough to punch through walls?

Mutants are not the ones in a position of weakness here. We are.

I understand that you have a strong interest in advocating for mutants. I am sure that you are
right that there are perfectly innocent mutants out there that get bullied every day, but I'm
sure that there are far more of them out there that fit in perfectly well.

Why, there's even a girl in my daughter's third-grade class with lovely purple hair. She doesn't get
bullied or ostracized in the way you described in your interview. In fact, the other girls are
wildly envious of her! My daughter asked just the other day if she could dye her own hair bright
pink. I said no, of course, but the point remains. The only mutants who are being kept out of
society are the ones who don't want to be a part of it.

I know my language must seem harsh here, but I think that your work is misguided and wrong.
Mutants should be looking inwards at how they can better control themselves and their 'fringe'
movement before they should be demanding concessions from the humans that have to coexist with them.

A Concerned Citizen,
