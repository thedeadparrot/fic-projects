Subject: Re: the breaking news

If we are in a sharing mood, I should tell you that Mystique sends her regards. I give you my
personal assurances that she is well. I realize that you are still protective of her, but she is far
smarter, far tougher, and far more resourceful than you have ever allowed yourself to realize.

I am, as always, glad to hear that the school continues on in my absence. Take care of yourself,
Charles. We may see each other sooner than you think.
