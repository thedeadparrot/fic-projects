The Brotherhood's business is, as always, our own. You are much less subtle than you think you are, Charles, and your powers do not work over e-mail, it seems.

I do not wish to disparage your work with the school, just the aims of your mission. Tolerance is
the lowest bar we could set for them, and year after year, they fail to clear even that one. No,
I will never be satisfied with mere scraps of acceptance. I will not beg them to allow my very
existence.
