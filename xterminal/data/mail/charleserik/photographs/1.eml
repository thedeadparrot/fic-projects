Subject: photographs and memories

I was walking along the harbor the other day (don't bother asking which one, Charles, I won't tell
you), and I couldn't help but remember our time in San Francisco. The hotel had very nice sheets, if
I recall correctly, and you were so delighted to walk along the water and take photographs of the
Golden Gate Bridge while it was shrouded in fog.

You were quite attached to your camera during that particular trip. Do you still have the
photographs of me by any chance? I suppose you might have burned them all after we parted ways, or
if not, they must be in some musty box somewhere, hidden away where you won't have to see them. But
then again, you always did have a streak of sentimentality, and so you might have kept them close.

That was a good trip. It's a pity that we didn't have many more like it.
