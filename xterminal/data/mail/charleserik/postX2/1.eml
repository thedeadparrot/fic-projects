Subject: congratulations

I have to commend you on your political victories, Charles, no matter how shallow they may be. Hank
being appointed as the Secretary of Mutant Affairs is quite a coup on your part. I'm sure you're
very proud. It won't change anything, of course, just another empty figurehead, a token show of
effort.

Though I cannot say that I miss that prison of mine, I do find myself thinking fondly of your
visits. Would you perhaps be in the mood for a new game of chess?
