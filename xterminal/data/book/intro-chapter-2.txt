I suppose that a memoir is not the medium by which one should record one's regrets. We all have
them, I imagine, some smaller than others, some larger. But if this is how I am to be remembered, if
this is how I will present myself to the world, should I not be more flattering to myself?

All the same, I feel as though this may be the last time for me to reflect on my past, the people
I have hurt, the mistakes I have made. I am not a man prone to self-doubt. One cannot afford it in
my position, and any moment of hesitation can and will be seized upon as evidence of my lack of
conviction by those who would condemn the mutant cause.

But despite all that, I believe what will bring us together, what will give us the shared empathy to
overcome our differences, is to understand that we are all flawed and that we are all, for a lack of
a better word, human. If I am to offer up my weaknesses and my failures, all the ways in which
I have failed both myself and the people I love, I hope it is in service of bridging the gaps
between our two peoples.

And as much as it pains me to say it, I have hurt far too many of the people I have loved.
