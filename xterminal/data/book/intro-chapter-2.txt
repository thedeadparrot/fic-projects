I suppose that a memoir is not the method by which one should record one's regrets. If this is how I
am to be remembered, if this is how I will present myself to the world, should I not be more
flattering to myself?

All the same, I feel as though this may be my last chance to reflect on my past, the people
I have hurt, the mistakes I have made. I am not a man prone to self-doubt. One cannot afford it in
my position, and any moment of hesitation can and will be seized upon as evidence of my lack of
conviction by both those who would condemn the mutant cause and those who believe that we have
not fought hard enough.

But despite all that, I believe that what will bring us together, what will give us the shared empathy to
overcome our differences, is to understand that we are all flawed and that we are all, for a lack of
a better word, human. If I am to offer up my weaknesses and my failures, all the ways in which
I have failed both myself and the people I love, I hope it is in service of bridging the gaps
between our peoples.
