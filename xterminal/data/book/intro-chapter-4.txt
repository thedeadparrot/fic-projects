Martin Luther King once said, "The arc of moral history is long, but it bends towards justice." 

Perhaps it shows a lack of faith to quote another person at the beginning of your own memoir, but it
is a quote that has sat long in my heart as a reminder of the goals of the mutant rights movement.
We have come very far over the last forty years, but we still have a ways left to go.

Over the years, and I have met so many other mutants, big, small, skinny and fat, strong and weak.
Ones with beautiful wings and lovely blue skins. Ones who could walk down the street without
a second glance. Ones who laugh at bad puns and those who always go ice skating in the winters. Ones
who have lived mundane, happy lives and ones who have suffered greatly at the hands of the ignorant
and the fearful. Though many of them are angry, (and I believe, rightfully so) I feel that we are
all united by a common goal, a desire for peace and safety for ourselves and the ones that we love.

There are those who believe that we will never achieve that goal through nonviolent means, that only
through intimidation and the show of power. But I am of the opinion that sort of thinking makes
ongoing conflict a foregone conclusion. We cannot make a future on foregone conclusions. Hatred can
only beget more hatred, and the cycle of violence will only lead us to more suffering in the long
term.

I am not a young man. The struggle for mutant civil rights will continue long after I am dead. I do
not believe it will be an easy road to walk, but I do believe it is one that we must walk, all of
us, together. I ask this of you, my brothers and sisters, my sons and my daughters, to be the better
people, to turn the other cheek. I ask you not to give into your worst instincts. I ask you to hold
onto hope, even when it becomes difficult. We owe it to ourselves, and to the children that will
come after us, to believe in that long arc of moral history.
