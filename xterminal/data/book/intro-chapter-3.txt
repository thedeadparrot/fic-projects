Mutation has always been the engine that drives evolution forward. It is what brought us from the
single celled organisms living in a primordial soup to what we are today: living, breathing beings
who exist in a delicate balance with the world around us.

There are times when the idea of such things astonishes me, that we come from such humble beginnings
and still have yet so much further that we can go. As a researcher at Oxford, I worked to uncover
the secrets of both the X-Gene and the set of mutations that has led us to this next phase of human
evolution. At the time, very few in the scientific community knew what to make of it, but of course,
that has changed.

I know there are those who don't believe in the genetic evidence that has been presented to them,
who believe that those of us with activated X-Genes are aberrations. I know the powerful grip that
fear can have on us. I have seen it in the eyes of far too many people. But I also know that we
must face down our fears and understand that perhaps the things we fear are not so strange and
different and from us than we might think.

The practice of scientific research is not perfect, and I do not wish to claim it to be, but
I believe in the power of scientific reasoning and progress. We are at our very base nothing more
than a collection of cells and chemical processes, and there is so much that science can tell us
both about ourselves and each other. 

In writing this memoir, I not only wish to tell the story of my own life but also to demystify the
science behind mutation and the X-Gene. I have always believed that peace must be attained through
greater understanding. If we allow ourselves to see past the surfaces of things, if we refuse to
make simplifying assumptions about each other, I believe that we will see that there is far more
that will draw us together than will keep us apart. We are not so different, after all.
