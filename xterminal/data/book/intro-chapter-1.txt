It is hard to pick where to begin a memoir. Humans lives are not so neatly defined as a story or
a novel. Their plot lines can disappear into thin air their and conflicts may never quite adequately
resolved.

For convenience's sake, let's start this story on the day I received my doctorate at Oxford.

It was rainy that day, I remember. My sister and I shared an umbrella as we walked together through
cobblestone streets. I had just been awarded my degree by the dissertation committee, and I was,
like many young men at that age, eager to visit the pub in order to properly celebrate. The pub had
been full, overflowing with other students. It was then, quite miraculously, that an opportunity
fell into my lap.

In those days, mutation was not well-understood. I had always known that I was different, that there
were things about myself that set me apart from my peers. My interest in genetics has always been
about understanding myself first and foremost, of unraveling the secrets of my own gifts.  I had
only ever known one other mutant my whole life: Raven, my sister. I suspected, as a result of my
research, that there were more of us out there, but until that moment, I had never thought
of seeking them out, of creating, in some way, a shared identity between us.

There are times when I wonder if I made the right choice that night. Ignorance, as it goes, is far
simpler than knowledge, and the things I learned about myself and about those around me was not
always pleasant.

But still, I am glad of it. I would not trade my life's work for the easier road. My students are
nearer and dearer to me than my own flesh and blood ever was. Every day, I am reminded that
mutantkind is just as broad and diverse and wondrous as the humankind that gave birth to us. I know
some who fear the future, but I am not one of them. Our children are bright and committed, and they
are ready to face down challenges we cannot even imagine. I believe they can learn from our mistakes
and our failures. I write this book not for myself but for them.
