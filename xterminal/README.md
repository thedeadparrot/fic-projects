XTerminal
=========

Most of this code is in pure Javascript. The things I wrote are `js/filesystem.js` and
`js/terminal-control.js` as well as everything in `data`.

[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) tests for filesystem code can be found in the `tests`
directory.

To see the underlying filesystem in the completed product, feel free to poke around at `data/files.json`.

Video support requires HTML5.

much of the heavy lifting on the interface, providing everything from login behavior to
tab-completion.
