Today&#39;s the second day in a row that you&#39;ve been forced to scavenge for food. You&#39;re low on nuyen, and the pickings are scarce, not much better than stale nutrisoy that&#39;s been thrown out. But even with your stomach rumbling, you have other pressing matters on your mind right now.]

[[No, but I&#39;m willing to play the game as long as he is.|Duncan 2A]]
[[He&#39;s harmless.|Duncan 2B]]
[[Does it matter? It probably beats this drek.|Duncan 2C]]

<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Duncan 2A" tags="duncan character" position="421,548">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Duncan 2B" tags="duncan character" position="620,549">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

Could be that this guy is just doing it out of the goodness of his heart, but then why the hell did he pick the two of us?

<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Duncan 2C" tags="duncan character" position="808,554">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

Yeah, I&#39;m hearing you on that. One more day of digging through a Stuffer Shack dumpster, and I&#39;d be willing to follow an axe murderer home if he offered me dinner.

[[...|Narrator 2]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Narrator 2" tags="narrator" position="622,748">[Duncan hasn&#39;t stopped talking about him, Raymond Black, over the last few days, a steady stream of thoughts, worries, wishes. Duncan&#39;s younger than you -- neither of you know by how much -- and he clings to any illusion of stability in a way that you&#39;ve learned not to. He nearly cried for three days straight when the diner kicked the two of you off their stoop.

He fidgets with his bracelet, a plain metal band that he&#39;s owned as long as you&#39;ve known him.]

<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Duncan 3" tags="duncan pc character" position="622,899">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

It&#39;s just that we don&#39;t know anything about this guy except that he&#39;s Chinese and he&#39;s got money to burn.


[[He&#39;s not married either. No ring.|Duncan 4A]]
[[We know he&#39;s willing to give us a place to live.|Duncan 4B]]
[[It probably doesn&#39;t even matter.|Duncan 4C]]</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Duncan 5" tags="duncan pc character" position="623,1219">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

Seriously, some stranger shows up out of nowhere when Lone Star is shaking us down? Says he&#39;ll get us off the street if we promise to behave? That doesn&#39;t happen to kids like us.&quot;

[[Well, it obviously did, because we have a decision to make about it.|Duncan 6]]
[[We should focus on what we need to do next, not why it happened in the first place.|Duncan 6]]

[[...|Narrator 3]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Narrator 3" tags="narrator" position="623,1519">[A noise echoes in the alleyway from the far end. This isn&#39;t the safest part of the Barrens, but it&#39;s the best you&#39;ve been able to find. Most of the nicer places don&#39;t like dirty kids hanging around and are likely to call Lone Star in to get rid of them. That&#39;s what happened the first time Raymond found them.]

<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Duncan 7" tags="duncan pc character" position="624,1663">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

[Duncan turns towards the noise.] What was that?

[[Probably some tweakers looking for some Jazz.|Duncan 8A]]
[[Maybe Lone Star got bored and decided to see what they could rustle up in the Barrens?|Duncan 8B]]
[[We should get out of here ASAP.|Duncan 8C]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Duncan 8A" tags="duncan character" position="485,1826">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

Well it&#39;s not like we have any money for them to steal.

<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Duncan 8B" tags="duncan character" position="628,1826">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

<tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Duncan 8C" tags="duncan character" position="778,1828">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

Yeah, that seems like the best option.

[[...|Narrator 4]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Narrator 4" tags="narrator" position="633,2001">[Shouting emerges from the shadows, and a burly troll steps into view. She&#39;s dressed in a Lone Star uniform, which is clean and pressed in a way that stands out amongst the grimy grittiness of the alleyway. Her mouth is full of sharp teeth, but her smile is gentle, almost motherly, and she speaks with a lazy Texan drawl.]

[[...|Lone Star 1]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Lone Star 1" tags="lone-star pc character" position="633,2151">&#39;&#39;Lone Star Officer&#39;&#39;

You kids should know better than to be out here alone by yourselves like this.

[[Yeah, and what are you going to do about it?|Lone Star 2]]
[[Did you come all the way out here to tell us that?|Lone Star 2]]
[[Why do you say that?|Lone Star 2]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Lone Star 2" tags="lone-star character" position="633,2301">&#39;&#39;Lone Star Officer&#39;&#39;

[Whispers] He really is interested in us, huh?

[You lean over to whisper to him as well.]

[[Maybe he&#39;s actually concerned about our safety.|Duncan 10A]]
[[Could be that Lone Star&#39;s lying to us.|Duncan 10B]]
[[We could try to make a run for it.|Duncan 10C]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Duncan 10A" tags="duncan character" position="463,2592">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

<tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Duncan 10B" tags="duncan character" position="630,2594">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

Wouldn&#39;t put it past them, though that&#39;s a lot of effort for them to go through for two kids if there isn&#39;t a payout at the end of it.

[[...|Lone Star 3]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Duncan 10C" tags="duncan character" position="786,2596">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

<tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Lone Star 3" tags="lone-star pc character" position="626,2774">&#39;&#39;Lone Star Officer&#39;&#39;

Seemed really concerned about you two getting into trouble out here in the Barrens. How&#39;d you meet him anyway?

[[We tried to steal his wallet.|Lone Star 4A]]
[[We ran into him at the station.|Lone Star 4B]]
[[Just showed up out of nowhere.|Lone Star 4C]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Lone Star 4A" tags="lone-star character" position="450,2931">&#39;&#39;Lone Star Officer&#39;&#39;

<tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Lone Star 4B" tags="lone-star character" position="623,2930">&#39;&#39;Lone Star Officer&#39;&#39;

You seem like a couple of kids who&#39;ve spent a little too much time there as it is.

<tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Lone Star 4C" tags="lone-star character" position="809,2937">&#39;&#39;Lone Star Officer&#39;&#39;

I get the feeling there&#39;s more to that story than that.

<tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Duncan 11" tags="duncan character" position="617,3097">&#39;&#39;Duncan Wu&#39;&#39;

[To you] Maybe we should just go with her. See what Raymond Black wants with us this time.

[[...|Narrator 6]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Narrator 6" tags="narrator" position="617,3545">[From the place where the alleyway opens up to a street you can see two shadows against the neon glow of the city behind them. Even then, you can see the bright orange logo painted onto their black jackets: a flaming jack &#39;o&#39; lantern. Halloweeners. One of the nastiest and most powerful gangs in Seattle.]

Nah. Wonder how much we could get off these two if we were to ransom them off.

[To his friend.] They look like a bunch of street rats, but I&#39;m thinking 30,000 nuyen easily.

<tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Lone Star 7" tags="lone-star character" position="617,4295">&#39;&#39;Lone Star Officer&#39;&#39;

[[...|Narrator 7]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Narrator 7" tags="narrator" position="617,4445">[There&#39;s a sixth sense you develop on the streets, an awareness of a situation is going to go south very quickly.

You grab Duncan&#39;s hand and drag him towards the cluster of dumpsters nearby. The two of you are just small enough to fit behind one of them, though there&#39;s still sharp metal bits poking you in the side.

From your vantage point, you can hear the sounds of shots being fired, can smell the acrid tang of gunpowder and blood in the air.]

They haven&#39;t even started to smell, yet. Duncan clings to your arm, his ragged fingernails digging into your skin through the thin shirt you&#39;re wearing. His eyes are wide. The Lone Star officer puts away her weapon and turns to the two of you. For a moment, her shoulders slump. She looks tired.]
