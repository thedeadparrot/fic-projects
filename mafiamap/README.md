This map was pretty much entirely built on top of the [Google Maps API](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/) and [JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/), both of which were incredibly easy to work with.

The icons were generated by the awesome <a href="http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/">Map Icons Collection</a>.

I found [this interactive map](http://universimmedia.pagesperso-orange.fr/geo/loc.htm) incredibly useful in my construction of this map, by making it simple to find the correct latitude and longitude needed for these markers.

All photography, with the exception of Christy's and the Police Headquarters, was taken by thedeadparrot.

The Police Headquarters photo is by [kingdafy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kingdafy/578404257/) on Flickr.

The photograph used for Christy's is by [EdKopp4](http://www.flickr.com/photos/edkopp4/3391916816/) on Flickr.

Feel free to reuse any of this code in any future projects you wish. I tried to keep everything as modular and reusable as possible, but please feel free to ask me questions about any of this if you want any explanations for any of it.

If you have questions or comments (or praise ;)), etc., [Let me know!](http://thedeadparrot.dreamwidth.org/501749.html)
