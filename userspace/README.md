Written in [Twine 2](http://twinery.org) using the Harlowe story format.

Just import the html file into the Twine 2 editor to get a look at it 
under the hood.

When I was working on this, custom CSS overrides weren't working inside
the editor, so I patched in the contents of `patched-css.css` into the
final html.
