[What You Want](http://thedeadparrot.github.io/fic-projects/edge-2/what-you-want.html)
=================

Another [Twee](https://github.com/tweecode/twee) story, that works as a sequel to [A Far Better Thing](https://github.com/thedeadparrot/fic-projects/tree/master/edge). Most of those directions also apply to this one.

Targets for Rendering
--------------------

I modified the Responsive target to build [this fic's target](https://github.com/thedeadparrot/twee/tree/master/targets/edge-2).
