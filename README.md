Fic Projects by thedeadparrot
==============================

Some of the fic I write/have written has code in it. I wanted to put up a place where people can see it, play around with it and customize it for their own use.

Mafia Map
----------

Built and written as a part of a [mafia AU](http://archiveofourown.org/series/9888) that takes place in Boston. I've been meaning to release the source of this for a while, but I never got around to figuring out how to make it easier for other people to set up and reuse.

The code and images used for this fic can be found in the `mafiamap` folder.

You can also [view the complete map](http://thedeadparrot.github.io/fic-projects/mafiamap/mafiamap.html) to get a sense of what it looks like.


A Far Better Thing
------------------

Written with the [twee](http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/) engine. You can find the code in the `edge` folder.


What You Want
-------------

A short sequel to A Far Better Thing aiming to pushing the experimental side of things. Also built using twee. You can find the code for this in the `edge-2` folder.


Ghost in the Shell
------------------

An experimental fic about exploring a character's computer. Built using [JQuery Terminal](http://terminal.jcubic.pl/). Can be found in the `xterminal` directory.
