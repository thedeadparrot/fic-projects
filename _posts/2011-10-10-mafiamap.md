Co-written with merisunshine36 as part of the [Sympathy for the Devil series](http://archiveofourown.org/series/9888). This was a super-fun combination of Google Maps, photographs, and short ficlets mashed together to make something I'm still really proud of. I think one of the joys of making this was the chance to revisit all these places around Boston that get mentioned in the series and put a visual on what and where they are.
