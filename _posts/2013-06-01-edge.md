Written using [Twee](https://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/). This was a particularly exhausting bit of writing because it ended being so long and so much worldbuilding had to go into it. I have some frustrations with extending some of the underlying Javascript, but I suspect that's what you have to deal with when you're messing about with the DOM. Overall, I'm still proud of it and the work that I did on it. It was quite an undertaking, but I still finished it.
