It had been a while since I worked on anything interactive, and I just watched a Double Fine video game documentary, and I was inspired to try it out again. The Twine ecosystem has changed a bit since 2015/2016, so I messed around with writing in Twee again and using TweeGo. Go figure that most of my interactive fic is about a loss of control, mostly because it's easier to write/program that way.
