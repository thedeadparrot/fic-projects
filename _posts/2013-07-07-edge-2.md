Written as a sequel to [A Far Better Thing](https://thedeadparrot.github.io/fic-projects/edge/a-far-better-thing.html). This was written over three days of a long weekend, partially because I wanted to try to write something short and quick, and partially because I wanted to see how else I could use the [Twee](https://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/) engine to tell different stories. I like the way this story contrasts with A Far Better Thing, where that one is bigger and more sprawling, driven by its plot, and this one is smaller, self-contained, driven by the emotions and the particular moment. It feels like they're opposite sides of the same coin, pushing at the platform in different ways.
