This was heavily inspired by [Gone Home](http://www.gonehomegame.com/), a game that I feel really captured the feeling of exporing spaces. I wanted to build something like that, with the computer terminal equivalent of locked rooms and hidden keys. I like that it's about a lot of different sides of Charles, the grand and the mundane, and I like the things that are hidden away.
