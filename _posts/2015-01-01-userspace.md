Built in a bit of a rush in Twine 2 so I could make the [Yuletide](http://archiveofourown.org/collections/yuletide) deadline, but I'm proud of it. I liked trying to capture the feel of Transistor -- its unsettling not-quite-realness -- and the quiet empathy it has for the people who inhabit its city.
